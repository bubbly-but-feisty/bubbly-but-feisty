Hello and welcome!
====================
I'm @bubbly-but-feisty from reddit :)
--------------------
For anyone who knows me from there, I'm interested in the intersection between economics, mental health, and (sex) work. I'll update this site regularly to keep everyone (especially those of y'all submitting answers) in the loop about the survey responses I get.

I'm a very curious person, and as someone who up until recently used to work in sex work and struggled with mental health issues I hope to learn (and share) more about topics like:

- For any given city, what are average prices sex workers demand for their services?
- Are sites like Seeking Arrangement used for "sex work"? If so, how do you neogitate prices (especially if you don't know how much other people are offering)?
- Are sex workers more at risk for developing mental health issues? Are people who live with mental health issues more likely to do sex work? If so, to what extent?
- In terms of policies, do sex workers want and need to ensure wellbeing and safety?

What I'm doing
--------------------
I'm  putting together a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UFhoblppfuJTAfDjUxq2PIRG7X1cJcwb7F9SS4gSMss/edit) asking questions like that through [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/bubbly_but_feisty), so I can share the answers to these questions.
These will be anonymous data and the code will be shared (so you can see what I'm doing). I'll post summary statistics and graphs to help demonstrate the data a bit once I hit my first 250 participants!

For privacy reasons I'm not posting as myself, but welcome any suggestions / questions / criticisms by email at: sababyanonymous@gmail.com

Thanks in advance :)
